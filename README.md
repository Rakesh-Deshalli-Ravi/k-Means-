# k-Means-
This repository contains a from-scratch implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm in Python. The code demonstrates core concepts including data loading, centroid initialization, distance calculation, and cluster assignment. It showcases the fundamental principles of K-means without relying on external machine learning libraries
