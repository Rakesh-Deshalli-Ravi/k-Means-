# k-Means-
This repository contains a from-scratch implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm in Python. The code demonstrates core concepts including data loading, centroid initialization, distance calculation, and cluster assignment. It showcases the fundamental principles of K-means without relying on external machine learning libraries



# K-means Clustering Implementation from Scratch

This repository contains a Python implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm built from scratch. The project demonstrates the fundamental concepts behind K-means clustering, including centroid initialization, distance calculation, and cluster assignment.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Random centroid initialization
- Euclidean distance calculation
- K-means clustering algorithm
- Visualization of clustering results

## Files

- `k-means.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the K-means implementation and examples


Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the K-means algorithm on sample data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Implementation Details

The K-means implementation includes:

- `loadDataSet`: Function for loading data from a file
- `distEuclid`: Function for calculating Euclidean distance
- `randCent`: Function for random centroid initialization
- `kMeans`: Main K-means clustering function
